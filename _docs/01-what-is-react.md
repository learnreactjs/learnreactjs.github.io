React is a UI library developed at Facebook to facilitate the creation of interactive, stateful and reusable UI components. It is used at Facebook in production, and Instagram is written in React.

One of it's unique points is that not only does it perform on the client side, but it can also be rendered server side, and they can work together inter-operably.
