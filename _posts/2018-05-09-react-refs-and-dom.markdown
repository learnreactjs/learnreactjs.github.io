Refs provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method.

In React data-flow, props are the only way that parent components interact with their children.

To modify a child, you re-render it with new props. However, there are a few cases where you need to modify a child outside of the data-flow.

The child to be modified could be an instance of a React component, or it could be a DOM element.

## When to Use Refs

* Managing focus, text selection, or media playback.

* Triggering imperative animations.

* Integrating with third-party DOM libraries.

***Noted:*** 

Avoid using refs for anything that can be done declaratively.

For example, instead of exposing open() and close() methods on a Dialog component, pass an isOpen prop to it.

## Creating Refs

Refs are created using `React.createRef()` and attached to React elements via the ref attribute. 

Refs are assigned to an instance property when a component is constructed, so they can be referenced throughout the component.

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.myRef = React.createRef();
  }

  render() {
    return <div ref={this.myRef} />;
  }
}
```

## Accessing Refs

When a ref is passed to an element in `render`, a reference to the node becomes accessible at the `current` attribute of the ref.

```javascript
const node = this.myRef.current;
```

The value of the `ref` depending on the type of the node.

You may not use the `ref` attribute on functional components because they don't have instances.

### Adding a Ref to a DOM Element

This code uses a `ref` to store a reference to a DOM node:

```javascript
class CustomTextInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // Create a ref to store the textInput DOM element
    this.textInput = React.createRef();
    this.focusTextInput = this.focusTextInput.bind(this);
  }

  focusTextInput() {
    // Explicitly focus the text input using the raw DOM API
    // Note: we're accessing "current" to get the DOM node
    this.textInput.current.focus();
  }

  render() {
    // Tell React that we want to associate the <input> ref
    // with the `textInput` that we created in the constructor
    return (
      <div>
        <input
          type="text"
          ref={this.textInput} />

        <input
          type="button"
          value="Focus the text input"
          onClick={this.focusTextInput}
        />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

React will assign the `current` property with the DOM element when the component mounts, and assign it back to `null` when it unmounts. `ref` updates happen before `componentDidMount` or `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle hooks.

## Adding a Ref to a Class Component

If we wanted to wrap the `CustomTextInput` above to being clicked immediately after mounting, we could use a ref to get access to the custom input and call its `focusTextInput` method manually:

```javascript
class AutoFocusTextInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.textInput = React.createRef();
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.textInput.current.focusTextInput();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <CustomTextInput ref={this.textInput} />
    );
  }
}
```

This only works if CustomTextInput is declared as a class:

```javascript
class CustomTextInput extends React.Component {
  // ...
}
```

### Refs and Functional Components

You may not use the ref attribute on functional components because they donâ€™t have instances:

```javascript
function MyFunctionalComponent() {
  return <input />;
}

class Parent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.textInput = React.createRef();
  }
  render() {
    // This will *not* work!
    return (
      <MyFunctionalComponent ref={this.textInput} />
    );
  }
}
```

You should convert the component to a class if you need a ref to it, just like you do when you need lifecycle methods or state.

You can, however, use the ref attribute inside a functional component as long as you refer to a DOM element or a class component:

```javascript
function CustomTextInput(props) {
  // textInput must be declared here so the ref can refer to it
  let textInput = React.createRef();

  function handleClick() {
    textInput.current.focus();
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        ref={textInput} />

      <input
        type="button"
        value="Focus the text input"
        onClick={handleClick}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Callback Refs

React also supports another way to set refs called "callback refs", which gives more fine-grain control over when refs are set and unset.

Instead of passing a `ref` attribute created by `createRef()`, you pass a function. The function receives the React component instance or HTML DOM element as its argument, which can be stored and accessed elsewhere.

The example below implements a common pattern: using the `ref` callback to store a reference to a DOM node in an instance property.

```javascript
class CustomTextInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.textInput = null;

    this.setTextInputRef = element => {
      this.textInput = element;
    };

    this.focusTextInput = () => {
      // Focus the text input using the raw DOM API
      if (this.textInput) this.textInput.focus();
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    // autofocus the input on mount
    this.focusTextInput();
  }

  render() {
    // Use the `ref` callback to store a reference to the text input DOM
    // element in an instance field (for example, this.textInput).
    return (
      <div>
        <input
          type="text"
          ref={this.setTextInputRef}
        />
        <input
          type="button"
          value="Focus the text input"
          onClick={this.focusTextInput}
        />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

React will call the `ref` callback with the DOM element when the component mounts, and call it with `null` when it unmounts. `ref` callbacks are invoked before `componentDidMount` or `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle hooks.

You can pass callback refs between components like you can with object refs that were created with `React.createRef()`.

```javascript
function CustomTextInput(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={props.inputRef} />
    </div>
  );
}

class Parent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <CustomTextInput
        inputRef={el => this.inputElement = el}
      />
    );
  }
}
```

In the example above, `Parent` passes its ref callback as an `inputRef` prop to the `CustomTextInput`, and the `CustomTextInput` passes the same function as a special ref attribute to the `<input>`. As a result, `this.inputElement` in `Parent` will be set to the DOM node corresponding to the `<input>` element in the `CustomTextInput`.
